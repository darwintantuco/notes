select * from users;

-- qualifying column name with table name
select users.firstname, users.lastname from users;

-- alias table name
select u.firstname, u.lastname from users u;

-- alias column name
select u.firstname as first_name from users u;
```

#### distinct

```sql
-- returns rows with unique firstname
select distinct firstname from users;

-- returns rows with unique firstname and lastname
select distinct firstname, lastname from users;
```

#### where

- use to filter rows

```sql
select * from users where firstname='Tony';
```

#### and

- if both are true, row is included

```sql
select * from users where firstname='Tony' and age > 30;
```

#### or

- if either is true, row is included

```sql
select * from users where firstname='Tony' or firstname='Steve';
```

#### between

```sql
select * from users where age between 20 and 50;
```

#### like

```

#### inner join

- matches column in first table to second
- doesn't deal with NULL values

```sql
select users.firstname, users.lastname, posts.title from users
  inner join posts on users.id = posts.user_id;
```

#### set functions

- compute new values from column values

#### count

```sql
select count(id) from users;
select count(distinct age) from users;
```

#### sum

select sum(users.age) from users;
select sum(users.age) from users where users.age > 50;
```

#### avg

#### max

#### min

#### group by

```sql
select firstname, count(firstname) from users group by firstname;
```

#### having

```sql
select firstname, count(firstname) from users group by firstname
  having count(firstname) > 1;
```
