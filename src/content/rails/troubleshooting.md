#### Postgres

##### PG::ConnectionBad

could not connect to server: No such file or directory Is the server running locally and accepting connections on Unix domain socket "/tmp/.s.PGSQL.5432"?

Possible causes:

- could be a stale PID file
- it could be failing silently because your computer didn't complete the shutdown process
- which means postgres didn't delete the PID

#### Fix

- Locate postgres directory
  - on osx using homebrew: /usr/local/var/postgres/
  - others: usr/var/postgres
- Remove .pid
  ```shell
  $ rm postmaster.pid
  ```

#### Others

A server already running.

```shell
$ lsof -wni tcp:3000

$ kill -9 processid
```
