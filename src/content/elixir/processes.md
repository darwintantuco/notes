#### Processes

very lightweight

each process is isolated from each other

a failure in a process will never crash or corrupt

another process

#### spawn

you can create a process using `spawn` function

its defined in `Kernel` module

```elixir
# run the function in another process
pid = spawn fn -> 1 + 2 end

Process.alive?(pid)
```

#### send and receive

```elixir
iex> send self(), {:hello, "world"}

iex> receive do
  {:hello, msg} -> msg
  {:word, _msg} -> "no match"
  end
```

#### spawn_link

allows process to establish relationship in case of failure
