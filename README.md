# notes

![Node.js CI](https://github.com/darwintantuco/notes/workflows/Node.js%20CI/badge.svg)

Collection of notes I find useful in day to day work.

Contains notes from books, blogs, articles, online courses, etc.

Anything under `/notes/` is not indexed/crawled by any search engine and only for my personal use.

If you think I violated any copyright, feel free to reach out, I'd be happy to remove it.
